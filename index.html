            <p>Hey everyone! Balancing studies and life as a student nurse can be tough, right? I've found that setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care are key. Remember, it's okay to say no sometimes. Let's keep reminding ourselves that our well-being matters just as much as our patients'.</p>

            <p>With our hectic schedules, fitting in a workout seems impossible. But I've started doing 10-minute exercise routines at home or even at school during breaks. It's amazing how a little can go a long way in keeping us energized and healthy!</p>

            <p>I've always found it challenging to maintain a healthy diet, particularly because my food preferences are quite selective. However, I've recently made a conscious effort to improve my nutrition by incorporating wholesome snacks into my routine, such as a variety of fruits and nuts, which are both nutritious and align with my tastes. Planning meals has been a game-changer for me. Sharing some of my quick, healthy recipes soon. Stay tuned!</p>
